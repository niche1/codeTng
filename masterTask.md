# Platform Outline
## Master Task 
1. Create the Beliefs that automatically fulfill all Local Ethical Human Needs in a Single Seamless Flow.
## Conditions
1. Only Collaborate on projects with Monopolist Characteristics that will Stay Above Immediate Demand. 
2. All Collaborators must be have a Core of Credibility.  Collaborators must trust themselves:
  -- A. Have integrity. Apply and improve their Character all the time.
  -- B. Be the change. Know what's needed and how to get it on schedule and with the fewest resources.
  -- C. Become a Generalist instead of a Specialist so you can work on the Entire System, instead of parts of systems. Generalization is why Generals are called Generals.     
  -- D. Deliver Results instead of Activities. Understand that the Best Results come from New Ethical Beliefs supported by New Actuating Events and are things people expect to be able to use at a cost as far below value as possible.
  -- E. This is where E would go.
3.   Use our Character to maintain Reliable Relationships. 
  -- A. Listen first to understand the other person's Beliefs so you can Exchange In Abundance with them.
  -- B. Operate from Shared Beliefs with all Collaborators.  Tell the truth and demonstrate integrity so there's no need to Spin, Posture or Manipulate. 
  -- C. Insist on Transparency in all work to make it hard for Hidden Agendas, Hidden Meanings and Hidden Objectives to survive.
  -- D. Make sure everyone gets meaningfully recognized for their work.  **Always** give credit to others ***before*** accepting credit for yourself.  Be loyal to the absent. 
  -- E. Drive out fear.  Promote Completely Safe Environments.  Safety is a better motivator for creativity, than fear. 
  -- F. Show Respect for Others through work on projects that produce more than enough for everyone that participates 
  -- G. Right wrongs through Acts of Creation.  When you bring attention to someone else's mistake, **always** participate in their Creative Action to fix their mistake. When you make a mistake, **always** get help with your Creative Action to fix your mistake, preferably from the person that brought your mistake to your attention. Nobody gets into trouble by themselves or should try to get out of trouble by themselves.  That's basic Systems Thinking.
4. Invest in our Competence.
    -- Treat Coding as a literacy instead of a skill. 
    -- Focus on what's needed to get Results through Version Control.
  -- Maintain Situational Awareness through Version Control.
  -- Account for what's actually happening through Version Control.
  -- Improve quality constantly and forever through Version Control.
  -- Keep your commitments.
5.  Extend Credibility, Character and Competence.
  -- To the organization.
  -- To buyers and providers.
  -- To society.
